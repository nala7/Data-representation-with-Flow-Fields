# Data Representation with Flow Fields

This project explores data visualization using flow fields to represent the dependency trees extracted from two ethereum client projects: (Besu)[https://github.com/hyperledger/besu] and (Teku)[https://github.com/Consensys/teku]. This project aims to visualize the common dependencies between these projects.

For the dependency extraction, this project relies on data from the following repository: (besu_teku_ssc)[https://github.com/nala7/besu_teku_ssc].
